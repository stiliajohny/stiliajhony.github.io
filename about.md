Hi, I am John Stilia.

Currently working in a DevSecOps position in which I am primarily getting involved with infrastructure and security.
I have a huge interest in security and development methodology, with a particular interest on mutable infrastructure.
On my free time I am getting involved with Python development, Docker and k8s as well as learning new ethical hacking techniques  on different topics.

Further, I am an Arch-Vim-Tmux user, which I can definitely talk hours about. Supporting Open Source since 2006 has changed the way I collaborate and interact with like-minded people.
