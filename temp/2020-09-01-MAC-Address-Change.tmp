There are times you need to change the MAC address to emulate another device or just get free Airport WiFi.
You may have few reasons.Maybe you want to hide your actual MAC address (also called physical address). <br>
Other case can be that the network administrator might have blocked a particular MAC address in the router or firewall.

One great ‘benefit’ is that some public network (like Airport WiFi) allows free internet for a limited time. <br>
If you want to use the internet after this limit, you just nee to trick the network believing tat you are a new device. It’s a famous meme as well.

Lets get straight into it.

First we need to find the interface you want to spoof the MAC address ( usually this is a wireless interfac  ).

* Open a terminal and look for wireless interface name
  * `ip link show`
